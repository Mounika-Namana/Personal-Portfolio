# Personal-Portfolio
Hi, I’m a Computer Science Engineering student passionate about building real-world software solutions.

My portfolio highlights my journey in software development, featuring full-stack projects built with React, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. I focus on writing clean, efficient code and creating user-friendly web applications.

I’m currently improving my DSA, exploring SQL and cloud deployment, and working toward becoming a skilled Software Developer.
